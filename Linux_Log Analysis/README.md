Log Analysis Script for Linux Systems
This is a Python script that analyzes log files from a Linux system and searches for suspicious activities. The script uses regular expressions to search for specific keywords that indicate potential security issues, such as failed password attempts, invalid user attempts, and reverse mapping checks.

Requirements
Python 3 installed on your system
Usage
Download the script to your Linux system.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script using the command python log_analysis.py.
Output
The script will print a list of suspicious activities found in the log files, if any. If no suspicious activities are found, the message No suspicious activities found. will be displayed.

Note
This script is intended to be used as a starting point for log analysis and should not be considered a comprehensive solution for security analysis. It is recommended to carefully review the script and modify it to meet the specific needs of your system.
