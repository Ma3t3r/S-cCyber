# Nmap Scanner Script
This script is designed to scan IP addresses or domains using the Nmap library. The user can input multiple IP addresses or domains, either manually or by reading from a file. The script will then perform a scan and provide information on the open ports, the number of hosts that responded to the scan, and the number of hosts that did not respond. The results of each scan will be saved in a separate file named after the IP address or domain.

# Usage
To use the script, you need to have the Nmap library installed. You can install it using the following command:

pip install python-nmap

To run the script, simply enter the following command in your terminal:

python nmap_scanner.py

The script will prompt you to enter either an IP address or domain, or the name of a file containing a list of IP addresses or domains. If you choose to enter an IP address or domain, the script will perform a scan and display the results in the terminal. If you choose to enter a file name, the script will read the file line by line and perform a scan for each IP address or domain.

The results of each scan will be saved in a separate file in the same directory as the script. The file name will be the IP address or domain, with a .txt extension.

# Example

Here is an example of how the script might be used:
Enter IP or domain, or filename: example.txt

# Scan results:
Number of open ports: 2
Number of responded hosts: 2
Number of not responded hosts: 0

In this example, the user entered the name of a file example.txt containing a list of IP addresses or domains. The script performed a scan for each IP address or domain and saved the results in separate files. The summary of the scan results is displayed in the terminal.
