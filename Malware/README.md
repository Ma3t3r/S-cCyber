#Understanding Malware and How to Protect Yourself
Malware is a general term used to describe malicious software that is designed to harm or control a computer without the knowledge or consent of the user. It can come in various forms such as viruses, Trojans, worms, spyware, and ransomware. Malware can cause harm to your computer, steal sensitive information, or even hold your files for ransom.

Here are some precautions you can take to protect yourself from malware:

Keep your operating system and software up to date. Software updates often contain security patches that protect against known malware.

Use reputable antivirus software and keep it up to date. Antivirus software can detect and remove malware on your computer.

Be cautious when opening email attachments or clicking on links. Malware can often spread through email and links to malicious websites.

Use strong and unique passwords for all your accounts. Malware can steal your passwords and compromise your accounts.

Backup important files regularly. This way, if your files are encrypted by ransomware, you can restore them from a backup.

#Using the Malware Detection Script
This script is designed to help you detect if a file on your computer is a known malware. The script calculates the hash of the file and compares it to a list of known malware hashes.

Here's how to use the script:

Download the script from the GitHub repository and save it to your computer.

Open the script in a text editor and replace /path/to/file.exe with the full path to the file you want to scan.

Run the script by executing python malware_detection.py in the command line.

If the script determines that the file is a known malware, it will display a message File is known malware. If the file is not known malware, the message File is not known malware will be displayed.

Keep in mind that this script is not a guarantee that a file is malware-free, but it can be a helpful tool in detecting known malware. It is important to also use other security measures, such as antivirus software, to protect yourself from malware.
