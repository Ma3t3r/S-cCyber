# XSS Vulnerability Test Script

This Python3 script automates the testing of XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities in a target URL. It is meant for educational or testing purposes and should not be used for malicious activities.

# How to use the script

Clone the repository to your local machine
Save the script as a .py file (for example, xss_vulnerability_test.py)
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved
Run the script by entering python3 xss_vulnerability_test.py
When prompted, enter the URL of the target page you want to test.
How the script works
The script uses the requests library to send a GET request to the target URL with each of the payloads defined in the payloads list. If the response text contains the string "alert", the script assumes that the payload has been executed and that there is an XSS vulnerability present in the target URL.

# Important notes

This script is only meant for educational or testing purposes and should not be used for malicious activities.
Obtain permission from the owner of the target page before testing for vulnerabilities.
The script is not a complete and exhaustive XSS vulnerability testing tool and may not detect all instances of XSS vulnerabilities.
